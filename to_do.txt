Ideas:

- Imbalanced learn might be a good place to look for this
	- ADAYSL
- Missing values:
	- Format numbers to be decimals, not scientific notation
	- Mostly in cat/car vars. One reg var too
	- Will want to try different imputation methods for each type
- Feature Engineering
	- Cont vars:
		- log + 1
		- bin
		- truncate past 95% percentile (make hyper-param)
